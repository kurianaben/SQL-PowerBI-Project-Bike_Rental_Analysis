Data Segmentation

Purpose:
-To break the data into meaningful user segments or scenarios to compare how different groups behave.

What it answers:
-Do people rent more during commute hours?
-Do weekends behave differently from weekdays?
-What happens during rainy commute hours?
-How do visibility or humidity levels change demand?

Why it's important:
-Segmentation allows deeper insight into specific user patterns and use cases, beyond just simple averages.
